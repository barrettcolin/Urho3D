Tests conducted with:

Quake2Data/CommandLine.txt:
+set sw_mode 2 // 512x384
+set cl_maxfps 200 // try not to time busy-waits
+map q2dm5

Urho3D:
-w -x 512 -y 384 // on desktop
-nosound // on desktop + RPi

Reference build:
Raspberry Pi ARMv6 @ 800Mhz ~32000us/frame (~31fps)
Atom N270 single core @ 800Mhz ~20500us/frame (~49fps)

Optimized build:
Atom N270 single core @ 800Mhz ~13500us/frame (~74fps)

Atom N270 notes:
Set CPU frequency to 800Mhz (conky shows 800Mhz, observed frame times are consistent)-
echo 800000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
echo 800000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq

Have to do cpu1 also, otherwise times are reported as though running at scaling_max_freq for cpu1 (1600000)

Disable cpu1 (not much difference apparent with -nosound):
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
